                But to Dr. Ido, the truth is all too clear. She is the one being who can break the cycle of death and
                destruction left behind from Tiphares. But to accomplish her true purpose, she must fight and kill. And
                that is where Alita's true significance comes to bear. She is an angel from heaven. She is an angel of
                death. Written by Anthony Harmon
